# KeyboardRecorder Firmware

This is the firmware for a device that I'm building that automatically records everything I play on my piano. The repository for the server and frontend website can be found [here](https://github.com/lachlansleight/KeyboardRecorder-Server)

The device is pretty simple - it's an ESP32, some power regulation and MIDI IN / MIDI THRU. The idea is that it lives on my digital piano and is on 24/7. There's no indication that recording is in progress, so after an initial 'getting used to it' period, you can just rest easy knowing that everything you play will be recorded for reference later. No more missing great moments or interesting ideas!

Eventually, this repository will also include a bill of materials, as well as CAD files for the PCB and 3D-printed enclosure.
